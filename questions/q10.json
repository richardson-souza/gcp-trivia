  "question": "Let\u2019s say a social media platform stores various details of their platform users such as session login time, URLs visited, activities on the platform and other logs. With GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliance to be officially implemented, the platform now allows users to download their activity logs from their profile settings which they can click a button to call an API to generate a full report. Recently, users are complaining timeouts after 60 seconds of requesting to download their activity logs at peak hours when the platform has the most traffic. They have to try for several minutes or even hours for the API to return their report available for download. How can you solve this issue?",
  "options": [
    "Use Pub/Sub to receive requests for activity logs from users. Deploy a Cloud Function with a Pub/Sub trigger to generate the reports and store them in a GCS bucket. Then, send temporary download links to the users via email.",
    "Migrate data source to Cloud Spanner for horizontal scaling to avoid query timeouts.",
    "Build a Dataflow pipeline to generate daily reports of users\u2019 activity logs. Users can download those daily reports whenever they want to.",
    "Increase timeout for API at peak times to 120 seconds. If it keeps failing, try increasing the timeout until the issue is resolved."
