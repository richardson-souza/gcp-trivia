  "question": "Let\u2019s say the data scientists at your company have successfully built a deep neural network machine learning model to detect car plate numbers entering and exiting a parking lot of a high-rise condominium. The model was built using Tensorflow and the model was exported as SavedModel. As a data engineer, you are assigned to deploy their model. The company is using Google Cloud for its project. Which approach is best for deploying the detection model?",
  "options": [
    "Deploy the model to Google Kubernetes Engine after wrapping SavedModel as docker image and uploading it to Google Container Registry.",
    "Deploy the model exported as SavedModel directly to Vertex AI in GCP.",
    "Upload SavedModel object to Google Storage. Use Dataproc with Spark ML to use the model by accessing it using Google Storage Connector.",
    "Deploy the model to ML module in GCP after asking the data science team to convert the model to binary format using PyTorch."
