  "question": "An analyst in Project A (`europe-west1`) needs to run an ad-hoc SQL query against a 50 TB table located in Project B (`us-central1`). Project A uses BigQuery On-Demand pricing. The analyst has been granted the necessary `bigquery.dataViewer` role on the table in Project B. When running the query, the analyst encounters high egress charges. What configuration setting must the analyst change to execute this cross-project query while minimizing cross-region data egress charges?",
  "options": [
    "Set the BigQuery Data Transfer Service to automatically move the table from Project B's region to Project A's region before querying.",
    "In Project A, enable BigQuery BI Engine reservation capacity to accelerate the query and mitigate transfer latency.",
    "The analyst must set the query job's processing location (or region) to `us-central1` (Project B's region).",
    "Use a BigLake external table definition in Project A, pointing to the original table data in Project B."
