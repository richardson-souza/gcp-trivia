  "question": "You are working at DataLoop Systems, and you need to monitor BigQuery usage through Google Cloud Logging (formerly Stackdriver Logging). Specifically, you want to receive real-time alerts through your monitoring system whenever new rows are inserted into a specific BigQuery table via an insert job.

  "options": [
    "Use the Cloud Logging API to list all logs, and apply an advanced filter on the client side.",
    "Go to the Cloud Logging interface and create a log sink that exports logs to BigQuery.",
    "In the Cloud Logging interface, set up a log sink that exports to Cloud Pub/Sub, then have your monitoring tool subscribe to the topic.",
    "Use the Cloud Logging API to create a project-level sink with an advanced log filter that exports to Cloud Pub/Sub, and have your monitoring system subscribe to that topic."
