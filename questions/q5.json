  "question": "You have a BigQuery dataset named 'customers'. All tables will be tagged by using a Data Catalog tag template named 'gdpr'. The template contains one mandatory field, 'has_sensitive_data', with a boolean value. All employees must be able to do a simple search and find tables in the dataset that have either true or false in the 'has_sensitive_data' field. However, only the Human Resources (HR) group should be able to see the data inside the tables for which 'has_sensitive data' is true. You give the all employees group the bigquery.metadataViewer and bigquery.connectionUser roles on the dataset. What should you do next to minimize configuration overhead?",

    "Create the 'gdpr' tag template with private visibility. Assign the bigquery.dataViewer role to the HR group on the tables that contain sensitive data.",
