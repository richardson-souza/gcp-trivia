        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Explanation for Question 27</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            As a data engineer preparing for the Google Professional Data Engineer exam, I must apply my knowledge of machine learning fundamentals, particularly concerning model evaluation in contexts involving imbalanced data, to solve this classification problem effectively.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Step-by-Step Analysis and Conclusion</h3>

        <h4 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">1. Deconstruct the Scenario and Identify Critical Constraints</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">
            The scenario presents a <strong>classification problem</strong> where the model predicts if a patient has a tumor.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            The critical facts are:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Imbalanced Data:</strong> Only <strong>1.4%</strong> of scanned patients are identified as positive for a tumor (the positive class is very rare). Datasets where one class appears very rarely are considered imbalanced.</li>
            <li><strong>Objective:</strong> The primary goal is to <strong>correctly identify patients with tumor</strong>. In a medical diagnostic context like disease prediction, the consequence of a <strong>False Negative (FN)</strong>—failing to detect an actual tumor—is typically more severe than a False Positive (FP).</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mb-4">
            When faced with an imbalanced dataset, simple metrics like <strong>Accuracy</strong> can be misleading. For instance, a model that simply predicts "no tumor" 100% of the time would still achieve a 98.6% accuracy, despite being completely useless for identifying tumors.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Therefore, the technique required must be an evaluation metric that specifically measures the model's effectiveness in finding the rare <strong>positive cases</strong> while accounting for the high cost of missing them.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">2. Evaluate the Proposed Options</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">
            I will evaluate the four options based on their function in the machine learning workflow, classifying them as either Optimization, Regularization, or Evaluation metrics (Wijaya, 2024, p. 261):

        <h4 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">3. Determine the Most Appropriate Metric</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">
            The goal is to maximize the correct identification of patients with tumors, which means prioritizing the capture of the positive class and minimizing <strong>False Negatives (FN)</strong>.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Recall</strong> focuses on minimizing <strong>False Negatives (FN)</strong>. The question asks to ensure the model can <strong>correctly identify patients with tumor</strong>—this directly corresponds to maximizing the rate of True Positives out of all actual positives.</li>
            <li>For applications like <strong>disease prediction</strong> where the number of actual positives is very low (1.4%) and a missed diagnosis (FN) has serious consequences, <strong>Recall</strong> is a more meaningful metric than accuracy or Precision. If you have a high Recall, you have a high probability of detecting the tumor if it exists.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">
            While Precision (minimizing false alarms/False Positives) is also important in diagnostics, <strong>Recall</strong> is the metric that specifically addresses the core operational requirement of detecting the rare positive instances in this high-consequence scenario.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">4. Conclusion</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Based on the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset and the critical need to identify the rare positive class (tumors), <strong>Recall</strong> is the most effective technique to examine the effectiveness of the model, as it measures the fraction of actual positive cases successfully identified.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg font-bold mb-4">
            The correct answer is B. Recall.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Techniques for High Performance Question Solving</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
            As a data engineer preparing for the exam, I used the following techniques:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Deconstruction and Keyword Identification:</strong> I immediately identified the context as "classification" and the critical constraint as the "imbalanced dataset" (1.4% positive). This realization immediately discounts common metrics like Accuracy. The instructional objective is to identify techniques that maximize performance significantly, which involves matching the right metric to the business goal.</li>
            <li><strong>Elimination of Non-Metrics:</strong> I quickly eliminated options A (Gradient Descent) and D (Dropout) because they are optimization or regularization techniques used <em>during training</em>, not evaluation metrics used to measure final model quality. This reduces the options to the fundamental evaluation metrics: Recall and Precision.</li>
            <li><strong>Contextual Optimization (High-Stakes, Imbalanced Data):</strong> I leveraged domain knowledge derived from the sources regarding metric trade-offs in imbalanced datasets and high-stakes scenarios (like disease prediction). The sources explicitly state that for imbalanced datasets and critical applications like disease prediction, maximizing <strong>Recall</strong> is preferred because minimizing False Negatives (missed tumors) is crucial.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mb-4">
            This structured approach, focusing on domain-specific constraints (imbalanced data, high FN cost) and leveraging category knowledge (metric vs. optimization), ensures the correct choice is made efficiently.
